# GraphQL + Express + MongoDB + Deploy Heroku

> A small project to illustrate using GraphQL with MongoDB in Express as simply as possible

#### Project Goals:
* Create a GraphQL + MongoDB + Express project that is as __simple as possible__
* __GraphiQL Integration__ to send Queries / Mutations
* Ability to use __Postman or other REST Client__ to POST GraphQL Queries / Mutations
* Use of __ES6__ (but minimally)
* Full Create, Update and Query from GraphQL to MongoDB

## Installation

#### ES6 / Node V4+
This project makes use of ES6 which requires a 4+ version of Node https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#### MongoDB
In order to run this project you need to install MongoDB and ensure an instance is running.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb

```js
npm install mongodb --save
mongod
```

To see the data you are saving you can use a MongoDB Manager App such as https://robomongo.org/

#### NPM Modules
The following NPM modules are required in package.json:

* express
* express-graphql
* graphql
* mongoose
* babel-cli
* babel-preset-es2015
* nodemon

Install with:

```js
npm install
```

#### Run the project

##### Running in Development
npm dev is configured with nodmon so that the server automatically restarts when code files are changes
```js
npm run dev
```

##### Running in Production
```js
npm start
```
npm prestart will run first, transpile the ES6 code and save to _dist_ folder. npm start will then run the code directly from the _dist_ folder

## Running GraphQL Mutations & Queries
You can run these queries / mutations within GraphiQL, alternatively you can run them within a tool such as Postman. To do so ensure you POST the query / mutation in the body and set the content-type to GraphQL.

#### Create a user
```js
mutation {
  addUser( name:"Jeff Beck", email:"jeff@beck.net", tel:"0800") {
    id,
    name,
    email,
    tel
  }
}
```

#### Find a user
Find the first user in the MongoDB, requesting just the name and email address
```js
query {
  userId(id:"56e0582a07be7df61583d9a4") {
    name,
    email
  }
}
```
#### Show all users
```js
query {
  users {
    id,
    name,
    email
  }
}
```

#### Update a user
```js
mutation {
  updateUser(id:"56e0919c2c4670ed23fe4a28", name:"Jeff The Beck", email:"jeff@beck.net", tel:"0800 234 231") {
    id
  }
}
```

## GraphQL Resolvers
GraphQL doesn't care where your data is stored, in this case it's in a MongoDB.

[userSchema.js](src/models/user/userSchema.js) uses a Mongoose Schemea and configures a number of exported functions for our GraphQL Resolvers to work with in order to load a user / list of users or create and update a user.

## GraphQL Schema
[userType.js](src/models/user/userType.js) creates a GraphQLObjectType describing the structure of our data model.

[userMutations.js](src/models/user/userMutations.js) and [userQueries.js](src/models/user/userQueries.js) specify the operations available from GraphQL and link to our resolvers, in this case Mongoose operations that return a promise.


## Deploy Heroku
Is considered you have install heroku cli so applie the steps into console CMD or some Shell 

1. heroku login

2. heroku create

3. After create project should  to go panel Heroku and define te variable URL_MONGO with the value conection string your mongo db, look the next image
![CLI Commands](https://github.com/xola139/graphql-express-mongodb/blob/master/readme/config_vars_heroku.PNG)

4. git push heroku master

When finished should to show some this


-----> Node.js app detected

-----> Launching... done

       http://arcane-lowlands-8408.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

copy the url of your console and paste in browser and test. ;)
